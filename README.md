Detection and Grading of Diabetic Retinopathy in Retinal Images using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks

Title: Detection and Grading of Diabetic Retinopathy in Retinal Images using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
Author:
Introduction: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) poses a significant threat to the eyesight of those with diabetes, especially if it remains undiagnosed in the initial stages. Historically, the diagnosis has relied on ophthalmologists meticulously examining retinal images. However, this method isn't without its challenges. It's lengthy, and results might differ based on the skill level or focus of the examining doctor on any particular day. With the swift progression of technology, the potential of machine learning, especially deep learning, in reshaping medical diagnostics is becoming evident. In our project, we intend to leverage deep convolutional neural networks to spot indications of DR in retinal images. We aim to expedite and enhance the consistency of the diagnostic process.
Problem Statement: Design and implement a deep learning system that can analyze retinal images, detect the presence of diabetic retinopathy, and grade its severity, helping in the early diagnosis and treatment recommendations.
 
Dataset Description:
Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Dataset: Contains over 35,000 high-resolution retinal images.
Each image is labeled with a severity grade for diabetic retinopathy on a scale of 0 to 4, where:
0: No DR
1: Mild
2: Moderate
3: Severe
4: Proliferative DR
Link to the dataset: Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Dataset
 
Technical Approach
Data Preprocessing and Augmentation:
Adaptive Histogram Equalization: Improve the contrast of the retinal images, which can accentuate the details and help the model recognize patterns more effectively.
Image Augmentation: Apply more advanced augmentations like elastic transformations and Gaussian noise, which can simulate the variations seen in real-world retinal scans.
Gaussian Blurring: Apply mild Gaussian blurring to reduce high-frequency noise in the images.
Handling Data Imbalance:
Diabetic Retinopathy datasets often have an imbalance, with many samples of "No DR" and fewer samples of severe cases.
Oversampling: Increase the number of samples for under-represented classes using techniques like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) adapted for image data.
Class Weighting: Assign higher weights to under-represented classes during model training, ensuring that the model doesn't become biased towards majority classes.
Model Design and Training:
Ensemble of CNNs: Instead of relying on a single CNN architecture, train multiple models (e.g., ResNet, EfficientNet, and DenseNet) and aggregate their predictions. This ensemble approach can capture a diverse set of features and reduce overfitting.
Attention Mechanisms: Integrate attention layers within the CNN architectures. Attention mechanisms will allow the model to focus on critical regions of the image, which is crucial for medical images where subtle features can be indicative of a condition.
Dropout & Regularization: Introduce dropout layers and L2 regularization to reduce overfitting, especially given the complexity of the models.
Model Evaluation & Fine-tuning:
Cross-Validation: Use stratified k-fold cross-validation to ensure robust evaluation. Stratification ensures that each fold maintains the same distribution of DR grades as the entire dataset.
Early Stopping & Checkpoints: Monitor the validation loss during training and implement early stopping to halt training when the validation performance plateaus. Use model checkpoints to save the best model weights based on validation performance.
Post-Training Model Calibration:
Temperature Scaling: After training, apply temperature scaling to calibrate the model's softmax outputs, ensuring that the model's confidence in its predictions is well-calibrated.
Interpretable AI & Validation:
Feature Importance Visualization: Beyond Grad-CAM, use techniques like SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) to provide a more comprehensive visualization of which features (pixels or regions in the retinal image) were most influential in the model's decision.
